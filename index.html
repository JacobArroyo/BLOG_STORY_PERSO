    <h1><u>My Athletic Diary</u></h1>

            <p>I started swimming when I was eight years old because my mother used to swim and dreamed of becoming one and in a way, she passed that dream to me. On my very first competition with Speedo, I won a gold medal in a team event which pushed me to continue competing until Grade 6. During those years, I joined around five to ten competitions, bringing home mostly silver and bronze medals and one gold from the Philippine Swim League and Speedo Jumpstart events.</p>
            <p>Then in Grade 6, I stopped competing and focused on helping my coach teach younger swimmers while still training seriously. When the pandemic hit all training stopped and I spent most of my time at home playing Counter Strike on my PC. In Grade 9, a friend introduced me to Olympic fencing, which I pursued for about three years despite a physically and mentally draining journey. I trained with intensity, often 7AM to 7PM on non-school days and 6AM to 12AM while balancing school and long commutes, but I struggled with my technical progress and my peers who started same as me advanced faster than I did. Eventually, the pressure, burnout, and internal conflict made me leave fencing altogether despite invested so much of my time, money, my physical and mental wellbeing it was not worth my time being in a toxic training club.</p>
            <p>During my final year in fencing in 2023, I was introduced to the gym and quickly fell in love with powerlifting, focusing on the squat, bench, and deadlift. Despite suffering a disc herniation in 2024 while deadlifting which made me immobilized and in gut wrenching nerve pain for 3 months, I recovered through self-research, physical therapy, and determination, and then returned stronger under proper coaching. In August 2025, I competed in the Luzon Equipped Nationals in Robinsons Ortigas and scored a 175KG squat, 97.5KG bench, and a 225KG deadlift but I almost got the 247.5KG on the last attempt. Although I am still managing my injury, I continue to grow stronger every day, driven by resilience and passion for the sport.</p>
